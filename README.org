[[https://play.rust-lang.org][Rust Playpen]] from within Emacs

*Warning:* I'm new to emacs-lisp, this is my first elisp toy. It just works, and I know a lot of work needs to be done.

** How to play
1. Install request by =M-x package-install request=
2. Add /playpen-mode.el/ to your load path
3. Open a new buffer, turn on playpen-mode by =M-x playpen-mode=, write a rust program.
   If you have rust-mode enabled, playpen-mode will turn on automatically.
4. Evaluate current buffer program by =C-c C-c e=
   Generate asm code from current buffer by =C-c C-c a=
   Generate llvm-ir code from current buffer by =C-c C-c i=

** Todo
+ +Make this a minor mode (For now I don't know how to do it)+
+ +Define different keybindings for compilation and evaluation+
+ Generate a new *Result* buffer each time
+ Adjust *Result* buffer proper mode according to the result, namely =compilation-mode=, =asm-mode=, =llvm-mode=
